 *  
 *  The abstract base classes are not sealed as the tree model is extensible.

 *  The base class is `Element` which extends `Product`, a constraint usually satisfied

 *  major element types. This way they may be part of the content of `SpanContainer` or
 *  `BlockContainer` types, traits that any element may mix in.
